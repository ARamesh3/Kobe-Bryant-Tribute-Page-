          <h3>Here are some of Kobe's career highlights:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nov 3rd ,1996 : </strong> Bryant made his NBA debut with the Lakers after the Charlotte Hornets drafted him with the 13th overall selection of that year’s draft, but traded him to Los Angeles. Though Bryant went scoreless on 0 for 1 shooting in six minutes in his first game, Bryant became the youngest player to ever appear in an NBA game at 18 years and 72 days old, though the record has since been broken. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>The start of a dynasty :</strong> Arguably the game that established the start of the Bryant dynasty with the Lakers, alongside center Shaquille O’Neal, Los Angeles erased a 16-point deficit in the final quarter in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against the Trail Blazers on June 4, 2000. The iconic play from that comeback was an alley oop in which Bryant found O’Neal.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>First Finals :</strong> Just a few weeks after that iconic comeback against the Trail Blazers, Bryant won his first of five NBA Finals trophies with the Lakers in a five-game series against the Indiana Pacers in the 2000 NBA Finals.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Youngest to 30,000 : </strong>On Dec. 7, 2012, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach the 30,000-point club when he connected on a jump shot during the first half of a game against the New Orleans Hornets.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Bryant outscores an entire team through three : </strong>Just one month before Bryant would notch his career high in scoring, Bryant outscored an entire team through three quarters. On Dec. 20, 2005, Bryant had recorded 62 points against the Dallas Mavericks at the end of the third period, while the entire Mavericks team had 61. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Kobe drops 81 : </strong>On Jan. 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points on 28 of 46 shooting and 18 of 20 free throw attempts in a 122-104 victory against the Toronto Raptors. That marked the second-highest single-game scoring performance in NBA history, second behind only Wilt Chamberlain’s 100 from the 1962 season. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Youngest all-star starter in NBA history : </strong>During the 1998 NBA all-star game, Bryant became the youngest-ever starter in an NBA all-star game at the age of 19 years and 170 days.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Torrid scoring : </strong>Over a four-game stretch in March 2007, Bryant scored 65 (against the Trail Blazers); 50 (against the Timberwolves); 60 (against the Grizzlies); and 50 (against the Hornets) to notch four consecutive contests with at least 50 points.</li>
          </ul>

              <p>He (Kobe) used to call me, text me, 11:30, 2:30, 3 o'clock in the morning, talking about post-up moves, footwork, and sometimes, the triangle.At first, it was an aggravation. But then it turned into a certain passion. This kid had passion like you would never know. It's an amazing thing about passion. If you love something, if you have a strong passion for something, you would go to the extreme to try to understand or try to get it.</p>
